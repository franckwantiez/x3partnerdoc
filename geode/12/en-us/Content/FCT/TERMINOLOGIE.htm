Cross-docking is used to optimize the input-output stock movements. In case of an arrival on the receipt dock and a DO has the same product on hold, cross-docking prevents putting the product away in the standard stores to take it out immediately afterwards. The product will go from the input to the output via a cross-docking type store.<br /><br />The cross-docking search consists in: <br /></p>
                                                            <ul>
                                                                <li>search of the stock (available or not) in the cross-docking store and of the unavailable stock in the reserve. If some stock is found, POs are created and printed.</li>
                                                                <li>search of cross-docking requirements in the Expected Inputs (status 2, 3 or 4) and the unaddressed Direct Inputs. Any requirement found is grouped on a cross-docking PO.</li>
                                                            </ul>
                                                            <br />There are two types of cross-docking (that can be set up at picking mode level):<br /><ul><li>Cross-docking in priority: upon launching of a wave, a cross-docking search is carried out in priority. If no cross-docking stock is found or no cross-docking requirement has been expressed, a standard addressing is then carried out.</li><li>Cross-docking in case of shortage: upon launching of a wave, a standard addressing is carried out and if there is a stock shortage, a cross-docking search is started.</li></ul><br />Notes: <br /><ul><li>Even if no requirement is found, it is still possible to create these requirements upon wave launching if the flag "Always express the requirement" is activated at output configuration level.</li><li>Launching the Cross-Docking POs is then used, when the stock is available in the cross-docking store (pending input or stock put away), to generate POs.</li></ul><br />It is necessary, for the Cross-Docking functionality to be activated on a site, to:<br /><ul><li>assign the cross-docking store at site level,</li><li>activate it in the depositor output configuration,</li><li>activate it in the picking mode of the DO, with "partial delivery" set to yes in the DO header and the merging of flows deselected. The delivery unit of the DO lines must be at level 5 and it must not concern a kit.</li><li>activate it in the "management" tab of the product records of those products that need to be managed with the cross-docking functionality.</li></ul><br />To be handled by cross-docking, an EI must have a receipt mode authorizing cross-docking and a DI must have its "cross-docking" setup set to yes in the "General" tab of its header.<br /><br />Important: the "quality control" process has priority over the cross-docking process.<br /></div>

If the system cannot entirely address the DO line, it will address it from the lot having the largest quantity except in case of prohibited partial lot (DO or line level) where the DO line will reveal a stock shortage.<br />Important note:  <u>the 'merging of flows' picking does not manage the single lot on output</u>. A DO line with the flag "Single lot" will be managed as a normal DO line with merging of flows.</p>

                                                            <p>- if the single lot mode is activated, the stock objects are necessarily differentiated.<br />- the single lot can be managed by means of the notion of multi-picking.<br />- the "single lot" mode means that at a moment m, there is only one lot number in a given picking location.  <br />- With a new input in an empty picking location, the lot is assigned to the location. When the whole picking stock is empty, the lot number is withdrawn from the location. <br />- The lot number requested in the DO line will be the number provided; if the stock of the requested lot does not suffice, the system generates a shortage. If the whole stock of a picking location with a lot A is pending output, and a DO related to a lot B is started in preparation, the system does not generate any shortage even if the output mode prohibits reserve output, and it searches the objects with lot B in reserve.<br />- if no lot is requested on the DO line, the system tries to sample stock objects according to the priority output criteria (objects can have a lot number or not ).</p>

                                                            <p>This SSCC no. is set up for each Warehousing depositor, and when it is activated for a given DO, it can be automatically generated for parcels and SUs: the generation for SUs makes it mandatory to use the SSCC for parcels.</p>
                                                            <p>Then the SSCC assignment can be triggered by the following events:<br />- wave launch with prepacking<br />- creation of parcels with declarative load preparation<br />- creation of Shipping Units</p>
                                                            <p>Some operations can be performed by entering the SSCC no. of the units, for instance: <br />- load preparation (in prepacking mode)<br />- palletization<br />- control upon loading.</p>
                                                            <p>The parameters linked to the SSCC management are:<br />- the customer file management<br />- the depositor management<br />- the output setup <br />- the DO header management</p>
