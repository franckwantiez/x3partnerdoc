Data extraction will be carried in a "flat" format for small folders, and using database extraction tools for larger folders.</li>
                                                                <li>New validation of the folder in the environment of update 8.0.0. This revalidation can be sub-divided into several stages, using the migration plan setup. If the folder is not too bulky, defining migration plans may not prove necessary. It becomes necessary if transfer processing routines need to be run in parallel (to benefit from the power of a multi-processor server) and their sequencing needs to be checked using resumption marks.</li>

These processing routines are supplied upon request, according to the release number, as a specific patch list dedicated to migration. Two types of procedures are delivered:</li>

The result of this control can reveal errors or inconsistencies which needs to be corrected before launching the migration itself. This control phase can be anticipated several weeks ahead of the migration, in order to have enough time to correct the data. It will nevertheless be necessary to relaunch it to check that everything is correct just before the transition to the next version. These procedures are listed in the <a href="../FCT/TRTMIG_X3.htm#MIS_20_10">corresponding documentation</a>.</li>

Since these procedures are independent from one another, they can be planned over several weeks prior to migration (the operation can resume as soon as the fields have been added). The purpose of these procedures is to significantly accelerate the actual migration stages. However, not launching these procedures does not jeopardize the execution of the migration procedures.

                                                            <p>This functional migration can be lengthy when the folder is very large. Moreover, some updated tables are potentially independent and, therefore, could be migrated in parallel, thus benefiting from multi-processor architectures to accelerate this phase.</p>
                                                            <p>To allow this migration to be scheduled in the best way, it is possible to define a customized <a href="AMOULIN.htm"> migration plan</a> before launching the data validation. This migration plan is described in the <a href="GESAM3.htm">migration procedure</a>&#160;function (called from the Supervisor folder). This function is used to define the stages, phases and procedures of the functional and supervisor migration. A migration plan corresponds to the definition of specific migration parameters (impacted folder, number of procedures that can be run in parallel, task sequencing policy, running status). A migration plan is created by recopying all the active elements of the migration procedure. This complete set of procedures is provided as a standard. It allows all the processing routines carried out by the standard software during the migration phase to be run exhaustively. A short description of these procedures is provided in a <a href="../FCT/TRTMIG_X3.htm#MIS_40_10">dedicated documentation</a>.</p>
                                                            <p>It is possible, at this stage, to define specific procedures by writing complementary processing routines in conformity with the methodology defined in the <a href="MIG_TRT.htm">following annex</a>. These specific procedures will be inserted in a relevant way between the standard procedures.</p>
                                                            <p>Once a migration plan has been defined,it is possible to launch it, interrupt it momentarily, resume its execution, and view its progress status.</p>
                                                            <p>When the volume of a folder is not too large and its migration does not require any particular planning, it is not necessary to create a migration plan. In effect, when there is no migration plan, the validation operation of the folder will automatically create a migration plan. The code of this migration plan will be the folder code, except if this code already corresponds to a migration plan that does not have the <i>Pending</i> status. If it were the case, the plan would be created with a predefined code under the form MIG<i>mmdd</i>M<i>##</i>. <i>mm </i>and<i>dd </i>are the numbers representing the month and the day of the launching, <i>##</i> is a sequential number.</p>
                                                            <p>However, to customize the migration sequencing options, it is possible to create a migration plan with a code that must correspond to the folder name. This creation will take place in the supervisor folder <u>before launching the folder validation</u>. If a migration plan exists, with the <i>Pending</i> status, it will be used for the functional migration of the folder.</p>

All three procedures TC1, TC2, TC3 must be completed before launching TC4, which will be running on its own since there are no other procedure in this phase. Then, TC5 and TC6 will be launched, and running in parallel.</li>
                                                                <li>When procedures TC5 and TC6 are both completed, tasks belonging to the module step can be started,</li>
                                                                <li>First, procedures MO2 and MO6 will be launched (in this order, these procedures run in parallel); then, as soon as one of these two procedures is completed, procedure MO4, the next one in the phase/module/rank order, will be launched in parallel with MO2 or MO6, depending on which one of them is not completed,</li>
                                                                <li>then, all former procedures must be completed before procedures MO1 and MO3, belonging to phase 2, can be launched. When one of them, at least, is completed, MO5 can be launched. Then, all former tasks must be completed,</li>
                                                                <li>MO7 can then be launched, as the only procedure in phase 5.</li>
