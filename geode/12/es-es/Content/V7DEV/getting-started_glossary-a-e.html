                                                <p>An access code is an alphanumeric sequence that restricts access to resources or data. It can be associated with a database record, a column of data (a field) in a table, an activity (a function), an operation, and so forth.</p>
                                                <p>An access code acts as a lock. Once it has been configured on a resource, users have access to this resource only if the access code is included in their assigned list of access codes. </p>
                                                <p>An access code is not specific to a particular user; it is meant to be assigned to many <a href="getting-started_glossary-r-z.html#users">users</a> through a setup of user’s rights that command the access mode. These rights represent the user's personal privileges and restrictions on a given access code. For example, a user can be given a Read access right on the table ‘Wages’ in the database, can display the data, but cannot modify nor delete it. On the other hand, a user can have No Execution access right on a process.  </p>
                                                <p><strong>Example:</strong>

                                                <p>The administrator creates a CFO access code and assigns it to the following elements:</p>
                                                <ol>
                                                    <li value="1">The wages account.</li>
                                                    <li value="2">The operation used to post an accounting entry.</li>
                                                    <li value="3">The authorized credit level property in the customer record.</li>
                                                    <li value="4">A detailed representation of the credit history for customers.</li>
                                                </ol>
                                                <p>On this newly created code, the user grants a user named MARTIN access rights that are restricted to Read<br />(no Write or Execution authorized).<br />Through the CFO access code, MARTIN has the following rights on the above mentioned data and functions.</p>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>
                                                        <p>To view the wages account (Read access right) without the ability to change its characteristics <br />(Write access right), nor to post accounting entries on this account (Execution access right).</p>
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        <p>To display the authorized credit level on a customer record without the ability to update it.</p>
                                                    </li>
                                                </ul>
                                                <p>However, the Read access right does not entitle MARTIN to post an accounting entry nor use the credit history inquiry (as Execution access right has been denied).</p>
                                                <p>As per the previous example, the Execution access right can be applied differently depending on the corresponding entity. The way the Execution access right is set on an account determines whether it is allowed to post accounting entries, hence the Execution access right on a representation corresponds to the right of use. For this reason, a detailed representation of the credit history for customers (4 above) is not authorized.</p>
                                                <p>This feature is generic. It already exists in Sage X3 Version 6 and is used in the same manner in Version 7.</p>
                                                <p>Note that a user can be granted rights on all access codes. This privilege is usually granted to administrators. Filtering by access code is disabled for <a href="getting-started_glossary-r-z.html#users">users</a> having this privilege.</p>

                                                <p>In an object oriented language, a class has <a href="getting-started_glossary-f-p.html#method">methods</a> which are functions implementing the access interface to an instance of the class. An accessor is a function that provides access to a <a href="getting-started_glossary-f-p.html#property">property</a> of a class. A manipulator is the term that designates functions used to update a property, but a unique term is used for the Sage X3 engine combining both types of functions.</p>
                                                <p>The evolution of version 7 for the Sage X3 engine makes it possible to define the following accessors:</p>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li><code>getvalue</code> is a method called to read the value of a property.</li>
                                                    <li><code>setvalue</code> is a method called to assign a value to a property.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                <p>Accessors invoke rules. Rules are dedicated methods called by the engine or the supervisor. For Sage X3, three types of rules exist:</p>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li><code>Getvalue</code> triggers an action when a value is read. This method is called by the read accessor.</li>
                                                    <li><code>Control</code> is used to verify the validity of a property when its value changes. The only action that is performed is to accept or refuse the update.</li>
                                                    <li><code>Propagate</code> is used to trigger updates on other properties when a property changes value in an instance.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                <p>The <code>Control</code> and <code>Propagate</code> rules are called by the <code>setvalue</code>.</p>
                                                <p><em>Note: The initialization (<code>Init</code>) method is neither called by the engine nor by the supervisor, but by the development partner once a new class instance has been created. Its use is not necessary if the instance is used only for read purposes.</em>
                                                </p>
                                                <h2 id="Activity" data-magellan-target="Activity"><a id="activity">Activity</a>

                                                <p>In a <em>Document</em> type interface, the user manages a document and uses a ribbon with a complex list of actions that enables the user to interact with the document. The version 7 platform has not been built that way. Its interface has been designed as a set of activities (for example, <em>create an order</em>, <em>display an order</em>, or <em>modify the order which is being displayed</em>). A user performs only one activity at a time, but other activities can be opened from the current activity, either by replacing the current activity by another, or by opening another activity in a new tab of the browser.</p>
                                                <p>A clear distinction is made between <strong><em>stateless</em></strong> and <strong><em>stateful</em></strong> activities:</p>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>
                                                        <p><strong><em>Stateless</em></strong> activities are queries or inquiries. A query is sent to the user interface. Once the answer is given, the server is available for another query which is not necessarily linked to the previous one. </p>
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>

This context is named a <a href="getting-started_glossary-r-z.html#working-copy">working copy</a>. Typically, data modifications or creations are managed by <em>stateful</em> activities.</p>
                                                    </li>

                                                <p>The application shell is the minimal envelope that appears in the browser when an activity is in progress. This envelope remains lean as it is the case in modern web applications, to have the maximum screen space available for the data directly linked to the activity. This is also done deliberately to avoid the endless bars of choices or esoteric icons. In its place the top bar will provide the main information such as a home button, user defined shortcuts, a search box, and a button that provides access to an extended bar with additional shortcuts including the list of pending drafts, the access to the personalization mode, the possibility to change the user or <a href="getting-started_glossary-r-z.html#role">role</a> for a connection, and so forth.</p>
                                                <p>A right bar gives access to the current operations (the default is displayed in blue). Finally, a small panel located at the bottom right corner gives access to alerts.</p>
                                                <p>Version 7 has been created as an application using all the Web browser capabilities. Thus, you can define activities as favorites by using the native favorites function in the browsers, using the back button to return to the previous activity, and so forth.</p>

Once <a href="getting-started_glossary-r-z.html#users">Users</a>  are authenticated, they can access their own customized portal to access the data in <a href="getting-started_glossary-f-p.html#mashup">mashup</a>.

                                                    <li>Row filters are used to define more restrictive filters on some properties using values such as horizontal habilitations. They were named roles in version 6 and before, but the role terminology now has a definition that is closer to the standard computing terminology.</li>

                                                <p>Blocks are part of the user interface organization, but the grouping in blocks has no influence on the application logic.</p>

                                                <p>A class is a data structure containing <a href="getting-started_glossary-f-p.html#property">properties</a> previously named fields. A class can contain properties of any type such as date, alphanumeric, numeric, rich texts or plain texts, binary data such as images, sounds, movies, instances of other linked classes, references to instances of other classes, and arrays composed with the previous listed elements.<br />For example, an « order » class, once instantiated, may contain properties referring to instances of other classes such as the delivering or invoicing address, as well as an array of references to order lines.</p>
                                                <p>The version 7 supervisor manages a class dictionary used to define them, with an optional association to a data type.<br />A class has a type that can have four different values:</p>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li><strong><em>Normal</em></strong> means that accessors can be associated with the properties of the class, but no methods for CRUD operations exist.</li>
                                                    <li><strong><em>Persistent</em></strong> means that accessors can be defined and CRUD operations are supported by the class. This is the case for the classes associated with resources usually persisted in a database: the data managed by the class will finally be stored in a database and retrieved through a query. The class definition is then the equivalent of the Sage X3 "object" (in version 6 terminology). On instances of such classes, CRUD methods (Creation, Read, Update, and Delete) will be used. The CRUD management on a class is more powerful than the object management implemented in version 6. If a class represents a document that persists in the database with a header and level(s) of nested lines, the supervisor manages the updates of the header and all the details with no limit of nested level, where the version 6 supervisor only took into account the header level.</li>
                                                    <li><strong><em>Technical</em></strong> is used when a class has no accessors, but might have associated methods.</li>
                                                    <li><strong><em>System</em></strong> is used for classes that have no accessors and in which no methods can be defined except kernel inbuilt and non-modifiable methods.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                <p>The class includes a set of methods describing business logic controls, default values, and functions used for data manipulation on the class properties.</p>
                                                <p>Using a class and its methods can be done through a user interface with a <a href="getting-started_glossary-r-z.html#representation">representation</a> and its facets, and also through a service (Web service).</p>

                                                <p>A function developed in version 6 cannot work directly with version 7 if the code and the meta data have not been reviewed and reorganized. The version 7 client use requires the separation between the business rule associated code (in <a href="#class">classes</a>) and the UI associated code (in <a href="getting-started_glossary-r-z.html#representation">representations</a>). The counterpart of this reorganization is that the code is more robust and easily reusable because the supervisor layer takes into account the updated <a href="getting-started_glossary-f-p.html#operation">operations</a> even on complex <a href="#class">classes</a>.</p>
                                                <p>As this reorganization of the code can take time and to simplify the use of version 6 dictionary elements and code in version 7, an additional UI layer named Transition has been developed for version 7. Hosted by the web server, this layer supports a UI enclosed in the version 7 shell using the version 6 interface logic with a style that is very close to the version 7 style. </p>
                                                <p>In this mode, a connection is established between the Web server and the Sage X3 engine in equivalent conditions to the existing ones in version 6. The node.js server acts as a simple proxy. The switch from a version 7 native page to a Classic page is relatively transparent (the Classic page overlaps the version 7 native page), but the advanced functions (<a href="getting-started_glossary-f-p.html#personalization-mode">personalization</a>) are limited. The Classic pages component is able to run the version 6 screens without any code reorganization.</p>

                                                <p>A collection is identified by a code in the class and representation dictionaries. The collections code used in a class or representation are associated with a minimum and maximum number of occurrences defined directly or through an activity code.

                                                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a computer language used to describe the presentation for HTML and XML documents. </p>
                                                <p>The standards defining CSS are published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Introduced in the middle of the 90s, CSS has been frequently used in the conception of web sites and well supported by the web browsers in the years around 2000. The development of the third level of CSS started in 1999, simultaneously to the development of CSS 2.1.</p>
                                                <p>CSS3 has become modular to ease its updates and its implementation by user agents with more diverse capabilities and needs such as graphical browsers, vocal browsers, and mobile browsers. The browser can consequently implement subsets of CSS3.</p>

This defines strict filter rules on the corresponding data. The data list is filtered by considering that the filtering field can only have the values associated with the rule for the user.</p>
                                                <p>For example, imagine that the 'GROUP' rule defines a filter on business partners, invoices, orders, and receipts on the value of the group customer code property, on every entity concerned. If this rule is activated for a user associated with the SAGE value, only the business partners, orders, invoices, and receipts having SAGE as a group customer will be visible by the user.

If the server is not available, the entry is not stopped: the modifications made are stored in the local cache. Some controls cannot be performed in this mode especially those based on business logic rules not implemented on the client or not available in cache, and the controls requiring a database access. These controls will finally be performed when the server is available, which will happen quickly in case of temporary disconnection (for example, a mobile device in bad network conditions), or later if the draft is reused to resume an interrupted entry.</p>

                                                <p>The following is an example of an endpoint SData.</p><pre xml:space="preserve"><code><a href="http://my_server:80/sdata/accounts_mgt50/gcrm_contract/demo_folder">http://my_server:80/sdata/accounts_mgt50/gcrm_contract/demo_folder</a>

                                                <p>For version 7, the segments have the following values:</p>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>The syntax for the server is the access <a href="getting-started_glossary-r-z.html#url">URL</a> to the version 7 platform, followed by the basic protocol (sdata): for example, <a href="http://my_server:80/sdata/">http://my_server:80/sdata/</a>.</li>
                                                    <li>The application can be Syracuse (to access the services supplied by the node.js server), or Sage X3 (to access the services supplied by a Sage X3 server). Also, any other application working with the version 7 protocol could be provided.</li>
                                                    <li>The protocol definition for Syracuse is collaboration. For Sage X3, it can be ERP, HRM, or other protocol name that will be defined later (for example, an SData contract dedicated to a specific data exchange with another software).</li>
                                                    <li>The <a href="#dataset">dataset</a> corresponds to an identified data source. For Sage X3, it is a unique name referencing a solution and folder code combination, exactly like the unique name given in the client-server connection box.</li>
                                                </ul>

This information will be stored in the ERP database or used to trigger a process. Entry modes are stored as a draft on the browser and on the version 7 node.js server. This draft updates asynchronously a context on the Sage X3 server. This update mode is <a href="#activity">stateful</a>.</p>
